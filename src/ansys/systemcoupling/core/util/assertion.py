def assert_(condition: bool, failure_msg: str = ""):
    """Function that can be used to replace ``assert`` statements in code.

    Assertions are not always preserved in run-time code and some tools will
    warn about their use. However, sometimes the use of an assertion seems
    appropriate to indicate something that should "never happen", such as
    when used to confirm an invariant or a pre- or post-condition.

    This function can be used in place of an ``assert`` statement and raises
    an exception if the provided boolean is ``False``. Since only ``assert``
    itself should raise an ``AssertionError``, ``RuntimeError`` is raised
    here.
