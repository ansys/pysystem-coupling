    Parameters
    ----------
    port : int, optional
        Port on which to connect to System Coupling. The default is
        ``None``, in which case an available port is found and used.
    working_dir : str, optional
        Path for the working directory of the System Coupling process.
        The default is ``None``, in which case the current directory of
        the client process is used.
    nprocs : int, optional
        Number of processes for coupling participants. The default is
        ``None``, in which case the System Coupling server uses its own default.
    sycnprocs : int, optional
        Number of processes for the System Coupling engine. The default is
        ``None``, in which case the System Coupling server uses its own default.
    version : str, optional
        String specifying the version of System Coupling to use. For example,
        to use System Coupling from the Ansys "2023 R1" release, specify ``"231"``.
        (The forms ``"23.1"`` and ``"23_1"`` are also acceptable.)
        The version will be sought in the standard installation location. The
        default is ``None``, which is equivalent to specifying
        ``"241"`` ("2024 R1" release), unless either of the environment
        variables ``SYSC_ROOT`` or ``AWP_ROOT`` has been set. It is considered
        to be an error if either these is set *and* ``version`` is provided.
    extra_args : List[str]
        List of any additional arguments to specify when the server
        process is launched. The default is ``[]``. If a list of additional
        arguments is provided, it is concatenated as-is to the list of
        arguments already being passed when the process is started. If
        an argument has an associated value, the argument name and its
        value should be specified as two consecutive items of the list.
