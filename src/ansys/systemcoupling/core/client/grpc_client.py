class SycGrpc(object):
    """Provides a remote proxy API to System Coupling's command and
    query external interface, built on a basic gRPC interface.

    An instance of this class controls starting System Coupling as
    a server in cosimulation mode and handles the underlying RPC (remote
    procedure call) to provide the command and query API. The
    ``start_and_connect`` method should be used to start the remote
    SystemCoupling instance, and the ``exit`` method should be used
    to close the connection and shut down this instance. Alternatively,
    the ``connect`` method can be used to connect to an already running server
    instance.

    This class supports two approaches to making API calls on System
    Coupling:

    # Using the ``execute_command`` method, which takes the command name
      as a string and a dictionary of keyword arguments.
    # Using the ``__getattr__`` method, which allows commands to be called
      as if direct methods of this class.

    Both of these are useful in different contexts.

    .. note::
       System Coupling runs in a server mode that expects a single
       client to connect after start up and which becomes the only
       means of controlling the server during its lifetime.

    TODO:

    - All calls are synchronous at the moment. We might want to do something
    different with the Solve() command. For example, you might want to
