# Requirements for running the "datamodel generation" script.
# The script runs System Coupling via the pySystemCoupling
# API and assumes that it will be run directly from the package
# source tree. The dependencies are therefore essentially the same
# as those of pysystem-coupling-core itself. Consequently this can
# also be used to define a debugging environment for pySystemCoupling
# development.
