# This requirements list might need tweaking. It was derived
# by comparing those from mapdl and fluent and excluding those
# that appeared to be specific to one or other product. Also
# excluded some like plotly, matplotlib, pandas and vtx, that
# do not seem relevant to SyC at this point.
# Where there was a version mismatch between mapdl and fluent,
# the higher version has been taken.
