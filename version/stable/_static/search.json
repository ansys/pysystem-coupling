Similarly, the CouplingInterface data model object\nin System Coupling becomes the coupling_interface data model object in\nPySystemCoupling.\n\nCommands and queries in System Coupling are all exposed in its Python environment as top-level\nglobal names. Commands in PySystemCoupling are exposed as callable objects that are accessible\nas attributes of one of the root attributes of the Session class:\ncase, setup, and case.\n\nIn System Coupling, you manipulate and query the setup data model in one of these ways:\n\nUse high level commands to create and initialize the main objects in the data model.\nFor example, use the AddParticipant command to add a new coupling participant and\nthe AddDataTransfer command to add a new data transfer object.\n\nAccess individual settings using a path-like syntax, starting at a root\nobject returned by the DatamodelRoot command.

To provide a structure to the settings,\nthey are organized as groups of properties in container objects.\n\nThere are two types of container objects: Container and NamedContainer.\n\nA Container object represents a grouping of primitive settings, accessible as\nproperty attributes. A Container object can also contain statically defined\nchild objects, which are accessible as attributes. For example, setup.output_control.results\nrefers to the results child of the output_control child of the setup object.\nThe names of child objects can be accessed with the child_names\nattribute of the Container object.\n\nThe names of the primitive settings attributes of a Container can be obtained via its\nproperty_names_types attribute. Although, this is mainly for internal use, its value\nis a list of tuples, the first element of each tuple being the name of a primitive\nsetting of the Container. As an example of such a setting, the option\nsetting of the output_control object is accessed as setup.output_control.option.\nThis particular setting is a string value.\n\nA NamedContainer object is a container holding dynamically created named objects of\nits specified child type, which is accessible via child_object_type attribute.\nBecause a specific named object can be accessed using the [] index operator, a\nNamedContainer object behaves somewhat like a Python dictionary. For example,\nsetup.coupling_interface['intf-1'] refers to the coupling_interface object with\nname intf-1. You can use the get_object_names() method in the container class to\nobtain a list of the names of objects held by the NamedContainer. In practice, the\nnamed object instances are Container objects.

This assignment can be done at any level. The assigned\nstate value should be a dictionary. Again, a more explicit alternative is\navailable in the form of the set_state method.\n\nYou query and assign individual settings as properties on their container objects.\n\nYou use the print_state method to print the current state of the container in\na simple text format."},{"objectID":"Home","href":"api/core/adaptor/api.html#commands","title":"Commands and settings API > Commands","text":"Commands\n\nCommands are methods of settings objects that you use to modify the state of\nthe app. The command_names attribute of a settings object\nprovides the names of its commands.\n\nYou can pass keyword arguments to commands if needed.

Arguments are also settings objects\nand can be either a primitive type or container type.\n\nThe implementation of the settings classes is sufficiently flexible to\nallow commands to be exposed at any level of the container hierarchy.

An\ninitial constant force in x-direction is applied to one side of the thin plate\nfor the first 0.5 seconds to distort it.

System Coupling is responsible for\ncoordinating the progress of each solution and for transferring variable data between the solvers\nat appropriate points during the solution.\n\nFor example, in a Fluid-Structure Interaction (FSI) case, pressure data is transferred from the\nfluid to the structural solver, and displacement data is transferred from the structural solver\nto the fluid solver. Because each solver is generally working with a different mesh, the transfer\nof data involves a mapping of the data from one mesh to the other. System Coupling is responsible\nfor performing this task.\n\nDescriptions follow of the main concepts.\n\nParticipants\n\nThese are the solvers, representing different physics types, that are being coupled.\n\nVariables\n\nThe participants expose variables. These are the quantities that are potentially available\nto be transferred.\n\nRegions\n\nThe participants also expose the potential regions on which the data may be transferred.\nFor example, in an FSI case, the relevant fluid regions would be the wall boundaries where\npressure is being transferred to the structure.\n\nInterfaces\n\nThese are the interfaces between participants.\n\nSides\n\nEach interface has two sides.\n\nEach side is associated with a participant and with a subset of the regions exposed by\nthis participant.\n\nData transfers\n\nEach interface must define at least one data transfer, which is a one-way transfer of\na particular variable (such as pressure or displacement) between the two participants’\nsides of the transfer’s containing interface. For a given transfer, one of the sides\nis regarded as the source of the data, and the other side is regarded as the target\nof the data. This defines the direction of the transfer.\n\nA coupled analysis can be one-way or two-way, depending on whether transfers are\ndefined in one or both directions on the interface.\n\nData model\n\nSetting up a coupled analysis involves populating a hierarchical data model of settings.\nThe data model closely follows the concepts that have been outlined here.

A reference to the session is also retained,\nand this will play a further role if solve is called later. In that case,\nthe participant solver will be driven from the Python environment in which the\nparticipant and PySystemCoupling sessions are active and System Coupling will\nregard the participant solver as “externally managed” (see the execution_control\nsettings in coupling_participant for details of this mode).\n\nThe participant_session mode currently has limited support in the\nbroader Ansys Python ecosystem - at present, only PyFluent supports\nthe API required of the session object and product versions of Fluent and\nSystem Coupling need to be at least 24.1. This capability should be\nregarded as Beta as it may be subject to revision when extended to other\nproducts.\n\nThe remainder of the documentation describes the more usual non-session mode.\n\nAdds a coupling participant to the setup.\nCannot be called after participants have been started.\nReturns the name of the participant.\n\nThere are several options that can be selected to add the\nparticipant - via a file, via a participant executable, or via a\nPython script. Some of these options may be combined. For example,\nsometimes it is useful to use an input file while at the same time\nproviding a custom participant executable or Python script.\n\nOption 1: Using an input file\n\nGiven an input file containing participant coupling information, reads the\nspecified file, pushes the participant’s information to the data model.\n\nOption 2: Using a participant executable\n\nGiven the path to the executable for this participant (and optionally,\nadditional arguments and/or working directory), start the participant\nexecutable, connect to the participant using the socket connection,\nand get the participant’s information and add it to the data model.\n\nOption 3: Using a Python script\n\nThis can be seen as a special case of Option 2 (using an executable),\nbut instead of an executable, a Python script is used. System Coupling\nwill invoke a specialized script to set up the environment so\nthat the Python script can more easily interact with System Coupling.\n\nParameters\n\nparticipant_session\n\nParticipantProtocol, optional\n\nParticipant session object conforming to the ParticipantProtocol protocol class.\n\nparticipant_type\n\npython:str, optional\n\nParticipant type.
