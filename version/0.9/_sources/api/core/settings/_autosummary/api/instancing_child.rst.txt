rotation_axis : `str`
    UNDOCUMENTED

instances_in_full_circle : `int`
    Total number of instances (including the first instance) in
    a full 360 degree rotation of the participant mesh. This value
    includes the reference instance (with the participant mesh).
    All instances defined for the instancing object have identical
    angles.

instances_for_mapping : `int`
    Number of instances to be included in the mapping when instancing
    is applied.
    
    Required when the number of instances to be used for mapping does
    not match the number of instances in a full circle. Default
    assumes a 360 degree rotation of the participant mesh. This value
    includes the reference instance (with the participant mesh).

reference_frame : `str`
    Reference frame that defines the orientation of the instancing.
    
    Rotation will be around the z-axis of the reference frame,
    following the right-hand rule.

axis : `str`
    Principal axis of rotation for instancing

axis_from : :ref:`RealVectorType<real_vector_type>`
    Define the starting point of a user-defined axis.

axis_to : :ref:`RealVectorType<real_vector_type>`
    Define the end point of a user-defined axis.

rotational_offset : :ref:`RealType<real_type>`
    Offset (in radians) about the rotation axis for the first instance
